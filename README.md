Are designed to be used in geektool widget app (and elsewhere). this allows you to make colourful markdown text live on your home screen.


# Geektool: 
To use the widget in geektool properly > drag a web widget onto your home screen > open the settings for that specific widget > set the HTML from address to script > next under script > click edit script and paste online-template.html or blank-online-template.html into the editor.

The script and style live in Github Pages, so that functionality and style(e.g. margin) can be updated en masse. But nothing stops you from appending to the style section for a particular widget if it is not supported by the better-markdown syntax.
